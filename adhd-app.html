        This project was part of a hackathon, where the objective was to create an app targeted toward mental health literacy and practices. In a team of 3, we created an app with a timer to help those with ADHD focus on tasks. This is a gamified approach that rewards users when they complete their tasks.

        At the beginning of the hackathon, my group and I brainstormed a list of questions we were curious about. We noticed that common themes from our questions revolved around schedules and focus, therefore we decided that ADHD is the closest mental health issue we can address since some people with ADHD struggle with focusing.

        <p>We did some preliminary research online and found that focus timers and lists were helpful for our target audience. I also did online interviews with several people with ADHD and they said that having a list or something that forced them to focus was helpful.</p>
  
        <p>After all the research was compiled, we created a focus statement that discussed the problems we were addressing. We also created flow charts to map the layout of the app.</p>

      <p id="prototype-p">My team member was responsible for creating a rough layout for the app. Once he finished wireframing, my other teammate and I prototyped the final app. I was responsible for sourcing the characters that we were going to use and I made sure they were cute and fun, which matched the style of the app. I also prototyped some of the final pages by adding branding to the elements.</p>
